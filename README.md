# Data-Analytics-and-Visualization
Completed a simulation as a Data Analyst at Accenture, where I provided strategic advice to a hypothetical social media client. I cleaned, modeled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover content trends and guide strategic decisions. I also prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to convey the key insights to the client and internal stakeholders.
